Pre-built Environments
======================

This module contains several pre-built experiments. Each pre-built environment is created by overriding the following components:

* **Action Handler** refers to overriding of the :meth:`~conformer_rl.environments.conformer_env.ConformerEnv._step` method of
  :class:`~conformer_rl.environments.conformer_env.ConformerEnv`, 
  which determines how the molecule is modified given some action.
* **Reward Handler** refers to overriding of the :meth:`~conformer_rl.environments.conformer_env.ConformerEnv._reward` method of
  :class:`~conformer_rl.environments.conformer_env.ConformerEnv`, 
  which determines how the reward is calculated based on the current configuration of the molecule.
* **Observation Handler** refers to overriding of the :meth:`~conformer_rl.environments.conformer_env.ConformerEnv._obs` method of
  :class:`~conformer_rl.environments.conformer_env.ConformerEnv`, 
  which returns an observation object based on hte current configuration of the molecule and is a compatible input for the neural net being used for training.

All pre-built environments inherit from :class:`~conformer_rl.environments.conformer_env.ConformerEnv` and share the same constructor.
